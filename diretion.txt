Click here:

to look at the finished page design. Using the finished design, create the HTML structure, including the logo, main banner, navigation, product grid, location, hours, and footer in index.html.





4.

Nice work! At this point, you should have the page's HTML written.

Begin writing the CSS to make the page match the desktop view of the page.

For reference, click here:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-5/secret-agent-supply/resources/images/redline.jpg


to see a design spec of the website's design. Design specs outline important design specifications to help you replicate the design in HTML and CSS.





5.

Great! Now you should have a good looking desktop site.

Now, resize the page to different widths, from large to small. You may notice the page breaks, or does not appear correctly when viewed on smaller screens.

Write a media query that targets a screen width less than 1024 pixels. 1024 pixels is near the size of a tablet in the portrait orientation.





6.
Inside of the 1024 pixels media query, make changes so that the site appears as in the tablet design here.

You can find the design spec here.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-5/secret-agent-supply/resources/images/redline.jpg


The changes include:

a) Changing the font sizes in the main banner.

b) Making the navigation display a "Menu" button instead of all the menu options.

c) Making only two products appear, both taking approximately half the screen's width.





7.

Resize your browser to an even smaller width, to simulate a phone's screen.

Write a media query that targets screens with a width less than 470 pixels.




8.

Refer to the mobile design here 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-5/secret-agent-supply/resources/images/mobile.jpg


and the corresponding design spec here. 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-5/secret-agent-supply/resources/images/redline.jpg


Use these resources to write CSS that makes the page consistent with the phone-sized designs.

The changes include:

a) Making the headline appear at the bottom of the banner and take up the width of the screen.

b) Changing the banner's font size to match the design.

c) In the product section, making only one product visible. It should take up 90% of the width of the screen.

d) Making the "Location" and "Hours" elements stack on top of each other.

e) The footer's text should be centered in the screen.

Resize your page and make sure that the appearance of the page changes in response to the screen's width.




Congratulations! You just built a responsive website that looks great no matter what device it's viewed on.
